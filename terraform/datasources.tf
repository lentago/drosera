# Auth is "Grafana Assume Role" — Grafana Cloud's own AWS account assumes our
# role, presenting this stack's External ID; no credentials are stored on
# either side. Because IAM role ARNs are deterministic, solidago's nightly
# teardown/standup DR drill recreates the role at the same ARN and this
# datasource never needs re-pointing.
