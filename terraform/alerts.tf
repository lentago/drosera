# Grafana-native alerting for the site probes. See docs/adr/0001-grafana-native-
# alerting-for-site-probes.md for the decision and its boundary.
#
# WHY this lives in Grafana and not AWS: `probe_success` and
# `probe_ssl_earliest_cert_expiry` are produced by the lab Alloy's blackbox
# exporter and remote-written to Mimir. They exist NOWHERE in CloudWatch, so the
# AWS-native alerting posture from solidago ADR-0001 (ALB/ECS/RDS → CloudWatch →
# SNS) physically cannot see them. This file covers ONLY those probe-derived
# signals; it does not add any CloudWatch-sourced rules — that boundary stays
# intact.

# drosera is a PUBLIC repo — the recipient address is never committed. CI passes
# it as TF_VAR_alert_email (see terraform/README.md § CI). No default: a missing
# value fails the plan loudly rather than silently shipping alerts nowhere.

# Ingest-absence alerts for the critical Loki streams (issue #150).
#
# WHY this is separate from the probe rules above: the failure class it catches
# is *silent ingest death*, not site downtime. Every silent failure this quarter
# was an ingest failure — a 3-day and a 9-day Loki outage (the 2026-07-10 incident
# report) and a 16-day Axiom outage (solidago#143), all of which stayed green on
# every existing safeguard. Nothing in the stack asked "is data still arriving?"
# These rules do exactly that: for each stream, count the lines over a cadence-
# appropriate window and alert when the count is zero OR the query returns no data.
#
# no_data_state = "Alerting" IS THE CRUX and is DELIBERATELY OPPOSITE to the probe
# rules above (which use "NoData"). For an absence alert, "no data" is not an
# ambiguous vantage-point failure — it is precisely the condition being watched
# for. A stopped stream produces an *empty* Loki result (a range-vector selector
# that matches no lines returns nothing, not a literal 0), so if NoData were
# suppressed or merely surfaced as NoData, these rules would stay silent through
# the very outage they exist to catch. The threshold on C (< 1) is the belt to
# no_data_state's suspenders for the rare case the query does return 0.
#
# SELECTOR CAVEAT: select on `log_source` ALONE. Streams may carry
# cluster="lentago-lab" (Fluent Bit / Alloy external_labels) while pre-2026-07-04
# data carries cluster="homelab"; adding a `cluster` matcher risks a selector that
# matches nothing and therefore never fires — the worst outcome for an absence rule.
locals {
  # Per-stream model, one entry per stream: adding a stream is a one-line change.
  # `window` is the count_over_time lookback (sized to each stream's cadence);
  # `from_seconds` is the rule's relative_time_range and must cover that window.
  #
  # firewalla_acl is the one stream the 2026-07-24 design comment on #150 flags as
  # fragile for pure absence detection: it is event-driven (ACL alarms only emit on
  # a matching blocked/allowed flow), so a legitimately quiet network can produce a
  # real zero. The comment's principle — constant-volume streams (zeek_dns/zeek_conn)
  # alert directly; a heartbeat is the robust mechanism for genuinely quiet streams —
  # is honoured here two ways: (1) firewalla_acl gets a materially wider 2h window so
  # a false zero is implausible on any active network, and (2) device_inventory needs
  # no special handling because its hourly cron IS a heartbeat — a known-cadence
  # emitter whose absence is unambiguous. A synthetic ACL-liveness heartbeat that
  # would let firewalla_acl detect faster is the robust long-term fix and is out of
  # scope for this Loki-only issue (see PR body).
  #
  # 2026-08-09 (#183): the four betula#58 streams join the contract. Measured 24h
  # volumes (Loki instant query, 2026-08-09): zeek_ssl 150k, zeek_http 89k,
  # zeek_files 46k, zeek_weird 10k — all effectively continuous on this network,
  # so they alert with windows sized to volume. zeek_notice measured 161 lines/day,
  # sparse and bursty by nature (it emits only when the engine raises a notice), so
  # per the same principle as firewalla_acl-but-worse it gets NO absence alert — a
  # quiet day is a real zero, and the checker script still reports it missing if it
  # goes silent for a full 24h.

# Site availability SLOs + multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerts (issue #195).
# See docs/adr/0008-site-availability-slos-and-burn-rate-alerts.md.
#
# WHY this is a distinct group from "Site probe alerts" above: those rules are
# SYMPTOM alerts — "probe_success == 0 right now" — which page on every blip,
# including a 30-second lab-WAN hiccup that consumes a trivial slice of the
# month's budget. These rules are OBJECTIVE alerts: they page only when the
# rate of failure is fast enough to threaten the monthly error budget, and
# ticket when slow erosion is eating it. The symptom rules answer "is it down?";
# these answer "do we need to care?" Both are kept — a hard-down still pages via
# the group above; this group adds budget-aware routing on top.
#
# THE SLO. 99.9% availability, measured as the fraction of successful outside-in
# blackbox probes over a rolling 30-day window. 99.9% is the honest target for a
# free-tier, homelab-fronted lab: the probe path crosses a residential WAN, a
# Proxmox LXC, and Grafana Cloud's free tier, none of which carry a four-nines
# guarantee — claiming 99.99% (52 min/YEAR) would be theatre when a single
# 5-minute home-internet blip already blows a year of that budget. 99.9% over
# 30 days = 43.2 minutes of allowed downtime per window, which is defensible:
# achievable on this infrastructure yet tight enough that a real regression
# shows up as budget burn rather than noise. The 30-day window matches the
# Google SRE Workbook's canonical burn-rate table (from which the 14.4 / 3
# multipliers below are derived) so the numbers are directly comparable to the
# published reference rather than re-derived for a bespoke window.
#
# NO NEW SERIES. Burn rate is computed inline with avg_over_time() at
# evaluation time — there are no recording rules, so this adds ZERO active
# series to Mimir (the stack runs ~9k of the 15k free-tier cap). Grafana-managed
# alert rules evaluate in Grafana's engine and are not remote-written back to
# Mimir either. See the PR body for the series-impact note.
#
# no_data_state = "NoData", identical to the "Site probe alerts" group and for
# the same LAN-vantage reason: a single-vantage probe can't tell a real outage
# from a lab/WAN outage, so suppressing NoData (→ "OK") would silence a genuine
# site outage that coincides with a lab outage. The failure mode stays noise,
# never silence.

# Bullpen (claytonia runner fleet) liveness + retry alerts (issue #207).
# See docs/adr/0009-bullpen-liveness-and-retry-alerting.md.
#
# WHY: game-day #1 (2026-08-17, lentago/.github fleet-reports/incidents/
# 2026-08-17-gameday-1-runner-kill.md) killed claude-runner-5 mid-job. The
# queue's stale-heartbeat reaper requeued the orphan (`.retry`) and a second
# worker finished it in 84s — fully autonomous recovery — and NO ALERT FIRED
# ANYWHERE, because nothing watches worker liveness or requeue events. The
# archive then volunteered two more real production reaps (2026-07-08) that
# also went unnoticed. This is the third "absence of expected signal" member
# in the family with #176 (Loki ingest absence) and #204 (red main-branch
# runs): silent self-healing hides real infrastructure problems (a host that
# reboots its workers nightly would look like nothing at all).
#
# BOUNDARY (from the issue): the alert rules belong HERE — drosera owns the
# observability pane. claytonia owns emitting any telemetry these rules need
# but that Loki does not yet carry. That boundary is load-bearing for the
# caveat below.
#
# SIGNAL — same one the Claytonia — Runner Fleet dashboard already renders.
# The dashboard's "Offload — concurrent runs" panel counts distinct workers
# from the `event="job_running"` heartbeat on `{job="claude_runner"}`
# (dashboards/claytonia-runner-fleet.json). That heartbeat is pushed every
# ~15s WHILE A WORKER IS PROCESSING A JOB. These rules build the headcount on
# the identical inner expression, aggregated to a scalar.
#
# LIMITATION — READ BEFORE TUNING. job_running marks BUSY workers, not
# idle-but-alive ones (the panel description says so verbatim: "distinct busy
# workers"). There is no always-on runner-fleet liveness heartbeat in Loki
# today: `session_running` is the workstation (`claude_local`) heartbeat, and
# the queue's own `workers/<host>.alive` 30s heartbeat is a git-queue FILE,
# not shipped to Loki. Consequence: on a genuinely low-load or idle stretch,
# fewer than 5 (or zero) workers will have run a job in the window and the
# headcount rules WILL fire even though every worker is healthy. The durable
# fix is claytonia shipping `workers/<host>.alive` to Loki as an always-on
# heartbeat (the boundary above) — at which point rule 1/3's query flips to
# that stream and the busy/alive ambiguity disappears. Until then these two
# rules trade some idle-period noise for closing the game-day gap; the retry
# rule (rule 2) has no such caveat and is the sharpest of the three. See the
# PR body — this whole group is marked needs-live-verify (no Loki creds in the
# authoring env, so the queries below are unproven against live data).
#
# NO NEW SERIES (15k Mimir cap): these are Loki-datasource rules evaluated in
# Grafana's engine — zero remote-written series, same as the ingest-absence
# group (the context-ledger group, which also lived here, was retired 2026-09-21).
locals {
  # ── HELD: worker-headcount rules (below-strength ticket + fully-dark page) ──
  # Live verification (2026-08-17, reviewer) confirmed the PR's own caveat is
  # disqualifying: `event="job_running"` marks BUSY workers, not alive ones.
  # Over a 3h window the headcount correctly returned 5, but over the rules'
  # 15m window an idle-but-healthy fleet reads as 1 (or 0) — the below-strength
  # ticket would fire on every quiet stretch and the fully-dark rule would PAGE
  # nightly (no_data_state = Alerting on an empty result). Held until claytonia
  # ships the queue's existing 30s `workers/<host>.alive` heartbeat into the
  # {job="claude_runner"} stream (claytonia#110); then both rules land with the
  # alive selector and none of this ambiguity:
  #   bullpen_expected_workers  = 5
  #   count(max by (worker) (count_over_time({job="claude_runner"} | json | event="worker_alive" [5m]) > bool 0))
  # The retry rule below has no busy-vs-alive dependency and ships now.

# Lab availability alerts (issue: 2026-08-29 pve3 outage post-mortem).
#
# WHY: on 2026-08-29 18:55 EDT pve3's onboard Intel I219-V NIC hit an e1000e TX
# unit hang. The PHY link stayed UP while transmit died, so the host was
# islanded for 17 HOURS, taking Home Assistant (VM 100 / HAOS, USB-pinned to
# pve3 and unable to migrate) off the LAN with it — and nobody was paged. This
# was NOT a monitoring gap: probe_success{job="integrations/blackbox/
# homeassistant-http"} sat at 0 continuously from 2026-08-29T23:00Z to
# 2026-08-30T16:00Z. It was an ALERTING gap — before this group, every rule in
# this file covered the public sites, Loki ingest, context-ledger, or the
# bullpen, and NOTHING watched lab host or Home Assistant availability. These
# rules close that gap; rule (a) alone would have caught the outage in 5 minutes.
#
# TWO INDEPENDENT VANTAGES, DELIBERATELY (rules b and c are belt-and-braces):
#   (b) outside-in ICMP pull — the LXC 105 blackbox prober pings the host; the
#       series dies when the host/NIC/LAN path between prober and host is down.
#   (c) inside-out metrics push — the host's own Alloy scrapes localhost:9100
#       and remote_writes `up`; the series dies when the host's Alloy stops,
#       even if ICMP still answers.
# They fail INDEPENDENTLY: a NIC TX hang (this outage) kills both, but a hung
# Alloy agent kills only (c), and a prober/LXC-105 fault kills only (b). Keeping
# both means a single-path failure still surfaces exactly which path broke.
#
# THE absent_over_time() CRUX (rule c) — do NOT "simplify" this to `up == 0`.
# node_exporter here is host-local PUSH: every host runs its own Alloy that
# scrapes localhost and remote_writes to Mimir (README § "central pull vs.
# host-local push"). When a host dies or is islanded, its `up` series goes
# ABSENT — it never reports 0, because the thing that would emit the 0 is the
# very agent that died. Verified against the real outage window:
# up{job="node",instance="pve3"} simply STOPS at 2026-08-29T23:00Z and resumes
# at 2026-08-30T16:30Z, with no zero samples in between. An `up == 0` rule would
# NEVER have fired. absent_over_time(up[10m]) returns 1 exactly when the series
# has been missing for the whole window, which is the condition we need.
#
# no_data_state VARIES per rule kind — re-derived from each query's shape, not
# copied:
#   * rules (a)/(b) query the raw probe_success gauge (0 down / 1 up) and fire on
#     `lt 1`. NoData means the single-vantage probe returned nothing, an
#     ambiguous lab/WAN-vs-target failure — so no_data_state = "NoData", exactly
#     as the "Site probe alerts" group above, keeping the failure mode noise not
#     silence.
#   * rule (c) uses absent_over_time, which returns EMPTY (→ NoData) precisely
#     when the host is HEALTHY (the `up` series is present, so it is not absent).
#     Here NoData is the normal, good case, so no_data_state = "OK" — the exact
#     opposite of the Loki-ingest-absence group, and getting it backwards would
#     make every healthy host page constantly.
locals {
  # Rule (b) — outside-in ICMP reachability. Every host here has a blackbox ICMP
