# Architecture decision records

This directory records the architectural decisions behind drosera as short,
dated decision records (the ADR / MADR style used across the fleet).

**Provenance.** ADR-0001 was written at decision time. ADR-0002 through
ADR-0007 were **reconstructed on 2026-08-13** from this repo's commit history,
issues and PRs, `CLAUDE.md`, the README, incident notes, and fleet session
archives — part of a fleet-wide ADR reconstruction. Their **Status** dates are
the *original* decision dates (with `reconstructed 2026-08-13` noted alongside),
not the day the record was authored. Every issue/PR/file/date anchor was
verified against the repo before being asserted; each **Alternatives** section
distinguishes options weighed at the time from ones marked *"retrospective —
not considered at the time,"* which were assessed after the fact and are never
presented as historical deliberation.
